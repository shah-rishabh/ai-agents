    "In the previous notebook, you built a **single agent** that could take action. Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n",

    "- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n",
    "- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n",

    "> ❌ **Note:** Avoid using the **Run all** cells command as this can trigger a QPM limit resulting in 429 errors when calling the backing model.
